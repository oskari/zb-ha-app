# Changelog

All notable changes to ZerryBit Engine are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`haCalendar` source** — Fetches upcoming events from a `calendar.*` entity
  via HA `calendar.get_events` at render time. Dense Finnish/English labels with
  optional `showDaysUntil` suffix, configurable window (`daysAhead`), event cap
  (`maxEvents`), and filters.
- **`calendarList` element** — Composite element expanded into stacked `text`
  lines before render (same pattern as `graph`). Groups same-day events under one
  date heading; binds to an `haCalendar` source.
- **Builder UI** — HA Calendar source type in Sources panel, entity browser
  filtered to `calendar.*`, calendar list inspector, and canvas preview.

## 0.1.2

### Added

- **Guided self-host setup.** Creating a new widget now opens a "How do you
  want to set up?" chooser — *Using the mobile application* (recommended) or
  *Self-host* (advanced). The self-host path provides a Postman-style form:
  enter your ESP32's LAN IP, press **Send**, and the add-on pushes the device
  `/config` for you, so the browser never has to talk to the device directly.
  Re-openable later from the Settings tab.
- **Server-side `/config` push proxy.** A new authenticated
  `POST /api/device/config` endpoint (HA Ingress only — never the
  unauthenticated image port) forwards a fixed-shape self-host configuration to
  an ESP32 on the LAN. The target is restricted to private-LAN (RFC1918)
  addresses with loopback, link-local, Docker, and HA-Supervisor ranges
  blocked; the address is canonicalized before it is dialed; the device port is
  fixed at `:80`; and the request is Zod-validated and capped at 1024 bytes,
  rate-limited, timeout-bounded (10s), redirect-refusing, and response-size
  capped.

### Changed

- **HA sidebar panel renamed to "ZerryBit Engine".**
- **Self-host setup UX polish** — the image URL auto-fills with this add-on's
  own endpoint, required fields surface clear errors on **Send**, tile
  selection is explicit, the image-URL help text sits next to its input, and
  the form spacing no longer shifts as you type.
- **Send → Continue on a successful push.** Once the device accepts the config,
  the **Send** button becomes **Continue** and the form locks; Continue (or the
  header ✕) goes straight to the builder. In the new-widget flow the canvas is
  sized to the full device screen from the sidebar toggle — 720×480 with the
  sidebar column reserved, 800×480 without.

### Fixed

- **Auto-save no longer wedges after a skipped save.** An internal "saving"
  flag could stay stuck on when a save was skipped mid-flight, silently
  disabling auto-save until the page was reloaded; it now clears correctly.

### Documentation

- Brought the ESP32 `.bin` endpoint documentation in line with the
  `POST`/framed-reply contract shipped in 0.1.1 (it was previously still
  documented as `GET /image.bin`).

## 0.1.1

### Changed

- **The ESP32-facing `.bin` endpoint is now `POST`, not `GET`.** It returns
  the self-host framed reply: a 25-byte header — width, height, refresh
  flags, next-wake, sidebar clock — followed by the 1-bit image, with bit
  polarity corrected to match the ESP32 wire format (`1` = white). The
  request body is never read. Existing self-host device configurations
  pointing at the old `GET /image.bin` will need to be reconfigured to
  `POST`.

## 0.1.0

Initial public release of ZerryBit Engine — a self-contained, fully local Home
Assistant add-on that renders 1-bit (e-ink) images from a declarative JSON
payload, with a built-in visual widget builder. No cloud dependency.

### Added

- **1-bit rendering engine.** A 7-phase render pipeline (Parse → Features →
  Sources → Context → Bindings → Draw → Encode) that outputs both a packed
  1-bit binary (`GET /image.bin`) for direct ESP32 consumption and a PNG
  (`GET /image.png`) for preview, with per-element error isolation and a global
  render timeout.
- **Drawing primitives.** Rectangle, circle/arc/ring, polyline, bitmap text,
  raster image, inline/fetched SVG, and recursive groups — with affine
  transforms (rotation, scale, pivot) and Bayer ordered dithering.
- **Bitmap font system.** Pre-rasterized Sora font set with nearest-variant
  size/weight snapping and family fallback.
- **Declarative data pipeline.** Parallel HTTP source fetching (JSON/XML/CSV/
  text), Home Assistant entity-state and history sources via the Supervisor
  API, dot-path field extraction, and a sandboxed binding/expression engine
  (`@zb/expressions`) shared by the server renderer and the builder preview.
- **Visual widget builder.** A local single-page builder served over Home
  Assistant Ingress for composing widgets, previewing server-rendered output,
  and saving or deploying payloads.
- **Dual-port architecture.** Port 8099 (HA Ingress, session-authenticated) for
  the builder and management APIs; port 8000 (unauthenticated, read-only) for
  ESP32 image polling. Renders are written with hash-before-write to protect
  SD cards.

### Security

- **SSRF protection.** All user-supplied URLs are validated against private and
  reserved IP ranges (including alternate IPv4/IPv6 encodings), with an optional
  domain allowlist and re-validation of redirect targets.
- **SVG sanitization.** Fetched and inline SVG is sanitized through an
  allowlist XML parser before rasterization; raw asset responses carry a
  locked-down `Content-Security-Policy`, `nosniff`, and force-download.
- **Input validation & quotas.** Zod schema validation at every API boundary,
  widget ID sanitization, request size limits, an expression evaluation budget,
  and per-host storage/asset quotas sized for a Raspberry Pi.
- **Container hardening.** The add-on drops Linux capabilities and ships an
  AppArmor profile.
- **Credential handling.** Source authentication secrets are masked on the read
  APIs and redacted from container logs.

### Known limitations

- **Open egress by default.** With an empty `allowed_source_domains`, the add-on
  can fetch any public host (private/reserved ranges are always blocked). Set
  the allowlist to restrict egress. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
- **DNS-rebinding TOCTOU.** A residual window remains between URL validation and
  fetch; documented and accepted for the local HA add-on.
- **In-memory rate limits.** Rate limits reset on add-on/container restart.
